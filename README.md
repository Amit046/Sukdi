This project is a basic visualization of a solar system, created using only HTML and CSS. It displays a sun and planets in motion.

## Features

* **Visual Representation**: Shows a sun with planets orbiting around it. The visualization includes a central sun and orbiting planets with curved paths.
* **Purely HTML and CSS**: The animation is achieved using CSS animations, without any JavaScript.
* **Simple Design**: A clean and straightforward representation of celestial movement.
* **Animated Orbits**: Planets move along their orbits.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML**: Provides the structure for the sun, planets, and their orbits.
* **CSS**: Styles the appearance of the solar system and animates the planets' movement.

## How to Use

1.  **Open the `index.html` file** in your web browser.
2.  The solar system visualization will be displayed, with the planets already in motion.

## Potential Future Enhancements

* **More Planets**: Add more planets to the visualization.
* **Accurate Orbits**: Adjust the orbital paths to be more accurate.
* **Scalability**: Improve the sizing and responsiveness for different screen sizes.
* **Interactive Elements**: (Note: Would require JavaScript) Add interactivity, such as the ability to pause or control the animation.
